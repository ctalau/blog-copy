  <title>Reuse non-DITA resources</title>

    <p>Besides DITA topics you can reuse other resources in your DITA project:<ul id="ul_xhl_nrm_d5">
        <li>Reuse images either referenced directly or via a key reference. </li>
        <li>Reuse other linked resources (like videos, PDFs and so on).</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>As binary resources are not embedded in the DITA topics, they are naturally reused by being
      kept in separate files and linked when necessary.</p>
    <image
        href="images/image9.png"
        height="50" id="image_jzc_fnz_15"/>
    <p>You can reuse images and link to other resources either via direct references or via indirect
      key references. What to choose may depend on how many times you refer to a certain image or
      binary resource. If you refer to it only once or twice you can use direct referencing.</p>
    <p>If you have problems getting images to appear the same size when published to PDF and
      XHTML-based outputs you should make sure they do not have the dots-per-inch information saved
      inside them: <xref
        href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/stretched-images-pdf-output.html"
        format="html" scope="external"/>.</p>
