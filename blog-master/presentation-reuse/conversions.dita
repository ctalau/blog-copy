        <li><b>XML</b> is an intermediary format. We don't do XML for the pleasure of it. We do it
          because we want to obtain multiple outputs from it and it has enough content and structure
          inside to allow for it. Some call this <b>single source publishing</b> but it can be just
          as easily be called <b>content reuse</b>.</li>

      format which contains all your data will contain more semantic meaning than any of the
      published outputs.</p>
