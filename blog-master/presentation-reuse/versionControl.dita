    <p>Version Control allows you to reuse content tagged at a certain point in time in order to
      produce older versions of your publications. So no matter what open source version control
      system like SVN or GIT you are using or commercial CMS, you should always have the possibility
      to produce older bug-fix versions for your documentation. So you can think of Version Control
      as content reuse on the time line axis.</p>
