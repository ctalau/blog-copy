        <p>The Word to DITA conversion uses the styles found in the Word document for creating
            structure and formatting the text into the output document. The converter ignores the
            font, size or color set on text content. To achieve the best results, the Word document
            has to be <i>well styled</i>.</p>
        <p>This preparation step assumes correcting various cases when formatting of the content was
            not made using styles. These are the things that you should take into account when
            checking the Word document: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>It's important to make sure that titles and headings were formatted using styles
                    because the topics and sections structure of the output document results from
                    these.</p>
                <p>This is an example of bad formatting: Instead of using the "<b>Heading 1</b>"
                    style, when formatting a title paragraph, the writer changed its font, size and
                    color, keeping the default "<b>Normal</b>" style: <image
                        href="images/badPractice.PNG" id="image_snc_hlw_pvb" placement="break"/></p>
            </li>
            <li><p>For the rest of the content, you can try to use the default Word styles for
                    creating semantics where it's possible. </p><p>This is an example of bad
                    formatting: Instead of using the "<b>Quote</b>" style, when formatting a
                    paragraph, the writer added it between quotes characters and changed its font
                    and alignment keeping the default "<b>Normal</b>" style:<image placement="break"
                        href="images/quote.PNG" id="image_bn1_gxw_pvb"/></p>Converting the
                paragraphs containing the "Normal" style will result in DITA p elements. So if you
                omit this step, you also have the option of adding semantics by post-processing the
                resulting DITA content.
                <p>
                    <note id="note_emq_bvw_pvb" type="note">The text content formatted using the
                        bold, italic, underline, strike-through, subscript or superscript actions
                        are handled by the converter. So you don't need to replace them with
                        correspondent styles like "Strong" and "Emphasis".</note>
                </p></li>
            <li>Save the shapes as SVG images because the converter doesn't support them. See the
                following link for more information: <xref
