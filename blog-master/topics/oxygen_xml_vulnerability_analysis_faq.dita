                    <li>Upgrade to the latest version of our products. We have already released new
                        minor bug fix versions for our products. For example, for Oxygen XML
                        Editor/Author/Developer versions 24.0, 23.1, and 22.1.</li>
                    <li>If you cannot upgrade to the latest version, patch or update the Log4j

                <ul id="ul_fhd_wvz_yrb">
                    <li>Oxygen add-ons may come bundled with Log4j 2.x libraries. Update all your
                        add-ons to their latest version by using the <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol> >
                            <uicontrol>Check for add-ons updates</uicontrol> menu action.</li>
                    <li>The Oxygen application may have external tools configured in the

                            Tools</uicontrol> page. Check that your external tools do not use Java
                        processes that may have this problem.</li>
                    <li>You may have configured extra JAR libraries used for validation or
                        transformation scenarios. Check that all of these separate libraries do not
                        contain the Log4j 2.x libraries. </li>
                    <li>There may be data sources (for example, for connections to eXist-db servers)
                        created in the <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol> > <uicontrol>Data
                            Sources</uicontrol> page that have references to Log4j 2.x libraries. If
                        this is the case, update your connection libraries to the latest ones
                        provided for the latest server installation.</li>
                    <li>You may run DITA publishing using an external DITA Open Toolkit publishing
                        engine that has older versions for the bundled Log4j 2.x libraries provided
                        by the Oxygen-specific publishing plugins. Update the Oxygen plugins used by
                        the custom DITA Open Toolkit to the latest versions available on our
                        website.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I am using the Oxygen SDK and cannot upgrade. How can I upgrade just the Log4j
                    library?<ul id="ol_rzm_mhz_xrb">
                    <li>Make sure that you do not have the version of Log4j hard-coded in your
                            <filepath>pom.xml</filepath> file.</li>
                    <li>You can control the version of Log4j to be included by adding the following
                        configuration in the <codeph>dependencyManagement</codeph> section of the
                            <filepath>pom.xml</filepath> file of your

                    <li>To test which version of Log4j your Maven project uses, run: <codeph>mvn

            <li>Am I still vulnerable if I block all outbound traffic?<ul id="ul_uyk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>If you block ALL the outbound traffic, you may be safe, but:<ul
                            id="ul_vyk_czp_xrb">
                            <li>Be sure to block also DNS traffic, as it can exfiltrate data such as
                                environment variables.</li>
                            <li>Be sure to re-assess which servers are trusted - maybe some trusted
                                servers had the same vulnerability and were exploited.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Regardless, it is a very good idea to restrict outbound traffic from Oxygen
                        tools. This will protect you against various types of vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Am I still vulnerable if I use a new version of Java?<ul id="ul_zyk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>The vulnerability is known to exist with the latest versions of Java (e.g. >
                        1.8u191) if you are also using <xref

                            scope="external">Apache Tomcat or Websphere</xref>. If you are not using
                        those servers, you may still be vulnerable, but we are not aware of any
                        exploits.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I remove the <codeph>JndiLookup</codeph> class?<ul id="ul_azk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>Yes. Removing it will remove the vulnerable code. We have high confidence
                        that other problems will not be generated.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I set firewall rules based on HTTP headers or URLs to block attacks?<ul
                    id="ul_czk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>These kind of rules do not offer full protection. The URLs that exploit the
                        vulnerability can be written in various ways and are not recognized by
                        common WAF rules that you might find.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>How to test if I am vulnerable?<ul id="ul_dzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>If you did not apply any mitigation, you can assume you are.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I do anything if the affected server is deployed inside the intranet?<ul
                    id="ul_ezk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>Yes. The attack can be triggered from another server that was exploited or
                        by one of the employees when they follow a link in a phishing email.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I upgrade to the latest version of your products?<ul id="ul_jzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>Yes. New maintenance builds that avoid this vulnerability are available for
                        versions that are in the maintenance period.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Is this vulnerability related to Java being insecure?<ul id="ul_kzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>No. It is caused by an open-source component called Log4j that had a
                        vulnerability. This component is widely used in the Java ecosystem.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>How is Syncro Soft addressing the problem?<ul id="ul_lzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>We patched all our public servers against this vulnerability.</li>
                    <li>We provided a security advisory with current solutions (<xref

                            format="html" scope="external"/>) and we produced maintenance builds
                        that remove the vulnerable version of Log4j for all product versions that
                        are under maintenance. We are working on solutions for older versions.</li>
                    <li>We analyzed and updated our internal servers to make sure they are not
                        vulnerable.</li>
                    <li>We scanned the logs of the services we use or provide to look for the
                        pattern that triggers the vulnerability.</li>
