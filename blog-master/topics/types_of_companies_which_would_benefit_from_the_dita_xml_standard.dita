        <p>In general, I would divide the companies that benefit from using DITA XML for their
            technical documentation needs in three large sections:</p>
        <dl id="dl_rtq_yb1_h1c">
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Companies Creating Physical Products</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>These companies create real-world objects, such as cars, refrigerators, or
                        computer chips. Each version of each product has an unique product ID and
                        needs to be documented. Different products are sometimes similar in
                        functionality but they also have some differences.</p>
                </dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Companies Creating Version-ed Software Products</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>These companies provide software components that are version-ed and usually
                        get installed on the client's side. As each client may have an older version
                        of the product, user manuals for older versions need to be made
                        available.</p>
                </dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Companies Creating Version-less Software Products</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>These companies usually provide cloud-based services, the end-user always
                        receives access to the latest stable release, and there is no user manual
                        made available for past releases.</p>
                </dd>
            </dlentry>
        </dl>
        <p>The benefits for companies would be as follows:<table frame="all" colsep="1" rowsep="1">
                <title>Benefits</title>
                <tgroup cols="4">
                    <colspec colname="c1" colnum="1" colwidth="1*"/>
                    <colspec colname="newCol4" colnum="2" colwidth="1*"/>
                    <colspec colname="newCol2" colnum="3" colwidth="1*"/>
                    <colspec colname="newCol3" colnum="4" colwidth="1*"/>
