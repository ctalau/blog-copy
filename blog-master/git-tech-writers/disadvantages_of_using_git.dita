    		<li>No built-in support for a ticketing system. <note id="note_b4n_421_rwb" type="tip">This
					support is added on the side either by using a commercial ticketing system (such
					as JIRA) or by using Git-based servers (such as GitHub or GitLab), which have
					their own basic ways of adding and closing issues.</note></li>
    		<li>No built-in support for publishing. <note id="note_ch3_p21_rwb" type="tip">Publishing
					pipelines need to be built separately.</note></li>
    		<li>No way to lock resources when editing to avoid conflicts.<note id="note_egd_q21_rwb"
					type="tip">However, there are ways to easily resolve most conflicts.</note></li>
    		<li>Mistakes can be made when using Git. <note id="note_fhr_r21_rwb" type="tip">Usually
					mistakes made that break the Git history or project structure can be reverted,
					or you can check out the entire project again.</note></li>
    		<li>Some training is required to use and understand the branching and history models in Git.
				Ideally, you should have a <b>Git person</b> who understands how to resolve
				conflicts, revert and cherry-pick commits, and in general, recover from any Git
				issues or at least who is willing to invest some time in understanding the Git
					model.<note id="note_gng_s21_rwb" type="tip">Such training tutorials and courses
					are readily available.</note></li>
			<li>Native Git is inefficient when asked to store large binary files (videos) or large
				numbers of binary files (images, PDFs) because every revision of every file is
				stored locally.</li>
    		<li>No granular support for user roles. Users usually either have full read-write access to a
				repository or read-only access.<note id="note_m5p_jf1_rwb" type="tip">When using
					GitHub or GitLab, users with read-only access to a repository can still create
					pull requests with the changes they want to incorporate into the main
					repository.</note></li>
